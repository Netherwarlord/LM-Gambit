## Test 1: Write a Swift function that solves the FizzBuzz problem.

*Source:* `test1.txt`

### Prompt:
```swift
Write a Swift function that solves the FizzBuzz problem.

The function must have the exact signature:
`func generateFizzBuzz(upTo max: Int) -> [String]`

It must not print directly to the console. Instead, it should return an array of strings.

Rules:
1. For numbers divisible by 3, the string should be "Fizz".
2. For numbers divisible by 5, the string should be "Buzz".
3. For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, the string should be "FizzBuzz".
4. Otherwise, it should be the number itself as a string.

Include a complete documentation comment (`///`) explaining what the function does, its parameters, and what it returns.
```

### Response:

```swift
/// Generates an array of strings representing numbers from 1 to max (inclusive),
/// where:
/// - Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced with "FizzBuzz".
/// - Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "Fizz".
/// - Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "Buzz".
/// - All other numbers are represented as their string equivalents.
///
/// Parameters:
/// - max: The upper limit of the range (inclusive) for which to generate FizzBuzz strings.
///
/// Returns:
/// An array of strings where each element corresponds to a number from 1 up to `max`,
/// transformed according to the rules specified above.
func generateFizzBuzz(upTo max: Int) -> [String] {
    var result = [String]()
    
    for number in 1...max {
        if number % 3 == 0 && number % 5 == 0 {
            result.append("FizzBuzz")
        } else if number % 3 == 0 {
            result.append("Fizz")
        } else if number % 5 == 0 {
            result.append("Buzz")
        } else {
            result.append(String(number))
        }
    }
    
    return result
}

// Example usage:
let fizzBuzzArray = generateFizzBuzz(upTo: 15)
print(fizzBuzzArray) // Output: ["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz", "Buzz", "11", "Fizz", "13", "14", "FizzBuzz"]
```

This function iterates through each number from 1 to `max`, checks the divisibility conditions, and appends the appropriate string representation of each number to an array which it then returns. The example usage demonstrates how you might call this function and print its output.

## Test 2: Create a complete SwiftUI view for a user profile card.

*Source:* `test2.txt`

### Prompt:
```swift
Create a complete SwiftUI view for a user profile card.

The view should be named `UserProfileCard` and be initialized with a simple `User` struct containing `name: String`, `handle: String`, and `avatarURL: URL`.

Requirements:
- Use an `AsyncImage` to load the user's avatar from the URL.
- Display the user's name in a `.headline` font and their handle (e.g., "@username") in a `.subheadline` font with a secondary color.
- Include a "Follow" button that uses the "person.badge.plus" SF Symbol.
- Arrange the elements cleanly inside an HStack with appropriate spacing.
- The entire card should have a subtle shadow and rounded corners.
```

### Response:

To fulfill your request, I'll guide you through creating a SwiftUI view named `UserProfileCard` that meets all the specified requirements. This example assumes familiarity with Swift and SwiftUI basics.

First, let's define our simple `User` struct:

```swift
struct User: Identifiable {
    var id = UUID()
    var name: String
    var handle: String
    var avatarURL: URL
}
```

Now, we'll create the `UserProfileCard` view. This view will use an `AsyncImage` to load and display the user's avatar, show their name in a `.headline` font, their handle in a `.subheadline` font with a secondary color, include a "Follow" button styled with the "person.badge.plus" SF Symbol, and ensure it has a subtle shadow and rounded corners.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct UserProfileCard: View {
    let user: User
    
    var body: some View {
        HStack(spacing: 20) {
            AsyncImage(url: user.avatarURL)
                .frame(width: 80, height: 80)
                .clipShape(Circle())
            
            VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 10) {
                Text(user.name)
                    .font(.headline)
                
                Text("@\(user.handle)")
                    .font(.subheadline)
                    .foregroundColor(Color.secondary)
            }
            
            Button(action: {
                // Logic to handle the follow action
            }) {
                Image(systemSymbolName: "person.badge.plus")
                    .resizable()
                    .frame(width: 24, height: 24)
            }
        }
        .padding(20)
        .background(Color.white)
        .cornerRadius(15)
        .shadow(color: Color.black.opacity(0.2), radius: 10, x: 0, y: 5)
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **AsyncImage**: This is used to load the user's avatar from a URL asynchronously. It ensures that our UI remains responsive while loading images.
  
- **HStack**: The entire card content is arranged in an HStack with spacing between elements for clean layout.

- **Text and Font**: The user's name is displayed using `.headline` font, and their handle (@username) uses the `.subheadline` font with a secondary color to differentiate it from the name.

- **Button**: A "Follow" button styled with the SF Symbol "person.badge.plus". This demonstrates how you can use system symbols in SwiftUI. The action for this button (currently commented out) would be where you'd add logic to handle following the user.

- **Background, CornerRadius, and Shadow**: These properties are used to give the card a subtle shadow and rounded corners, enhancing its visual appeal and making it stand out on the screen.

This `UserProfileCard` view is now ready to be integrated into your SwiftUI application. You can create instances of this view by passing in `User` structs that conform to the structure defined above.

## Test 3: I have this old networking code that uses a completion handler. Please refactor it to use modern Swift Concurrency with async/await.

*Source:* `test3.txt`

### Prompt:
```swift
I have this old networking code that uses a completion handler. Please refactor it to use modern Swift Concurrency with async/await.

The new function should be marked with `async throws` and return a `[Post]` object upon success. Also, include an example of how to call this new async function inside a `Task` with a `do-catch` block.

**Old Code:**
struct Post: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let title: String
}

func fetchPosts(completion: @escaping (Result<[Post], Error>) -> Void) {
    guard let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/posts") else { return }
    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, _, error in
        if let error = error { completion(.failure(error)); return }
        guard let data = data else { return }
        do {
            let posts = try JSONDecoder().decode([Post].self, from: data)
            completion(.success(posts))
        } catch {
            completion(.failure(error))
        }
    }.resume()
}
```

### Response:

To refactor the given networking code to use modern Swift Concurrency with async/await, you can follow these steps:

1. **Mark the Function as Async**: Change the function signature of `fetchPosts` to be asynchronous and capable of throwing errors.
2. **Use async/await**: Inside the function, use `async throws` to fetch data from the URL and decode it into a `[Post]`.
3. **Handle Completion with do-catch**: When calling this new async function, wrap the call inside a `do-catch` block within a `Task`.

Here's how you can refactor the code:

```swift
import Foundation

struct Post: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let title: String
}

// Refactored to use async/await
func fetchPosts() async throws -> [Post] {
    guard let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/posts") else { throw NSError(domain: "", code: -1, userInfo: nil) }
    
    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "GET"
    
    let (data, response, error) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)
    
    if let error = error {
        throw error
    }
    
    guard let data = data else { throw NSError(domain: "", code: -2, userInfo: nil) }
    
    do {
        return try JSONDecoder().decode([Post].self, from: data)
    } catch {
        throw error
    }
}

// Example of calling the new async function inside a Task with a do-catch block
Task {
    do {
        let posts = try await fetchPosts()
        print(posts) // Handle or display the fetched posts
    } catch {
        print("Failed to fetch posts: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Async Function**: The `fetchPosts` function is now marked with `async throws`, indicating it's an asynchronous function that can throw errors.
- **Using async/await**: Inside the function, `URLSession.shared.data(for:)` is awaited using `try await`. This allows for non-blocking network operations and makes the code more readable by avoiding callbacks or completion handlers.
- **Error Handling**: Errors from the URL session request are thrown directly. If data fetching fails or decoding JSON fails, those errors are also caught and re-thrown to be handled externally.
- **Calling with do-catch in a Task**: The `Task` construct is used to call `fetchPosts()` asynchronously. Inside the `do-catch` block, we await the result of `fetchPosts()`. If successful, it prints the fetched posts; otherwise, it catches and prints any errors that occurred.

This refactoring leverages Swift's modern concurrency features for cleaner, more readable asynchronous code handling.

## Test 4: Create a complete SwiftData example for a macOS 26 app.

*Source:* `test4.txt`

### Prompt:
```swift
Create a complete SwiftData example for a macOS 26 app.

You must define two models: `Author` and `Book`. An `Author` can have many `Book`s (a one-to-many relationship).

Then, create a SwiftUI view that displays a list of all authors. When an author's name is tapped, it should navigate to a detail view that shows a list of all the books written by that specific author. Use a SwiftData `@Query` to fetch the data.
```

### Response:

Certainly! Here's a complete example using Swift Data and SwiftUI for a macOS 26 app with two models: `Author` and `Book`, along with a SwiftUI view that displays authors and their books:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SwiftData

// Author model
@Model
struct Author: Identifiable {
    var id: String { name }
    var name: String
    @Children(for: \.$author) var books: [Book]
}

// Book model
@Model
struct Book: Identifiable {
    var id: String { title }
    var title: String
    var authorId: String
    @Parent(for: \.$books) var author: Author?
}

// ContentView.swift

struct ContentView: View {
    @Query(authorQuery) private var authors: [Author]
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(authors) { author in
                Text(author.name)
                    .onTapGesture {
                        // Navigate to the detail view when an author's name is tapped
                        let selectedAuthor = authors.first(where: { $0.name == author.name })
                        // Assuming you have a DetailView that takes an Author as parameter
                        // Replace "DetailView(author: selectedAuthor!)" with your actual DetailView
                    }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Authors")
        }
    }
}

// Query for fetching authors
@Query
private func authorQuery() -> [Author] {
    return try? Store.fetch(authorFetchRequest)
}

// AuthorFetchRequest for fetching authors from SwiftData store
let authorFetchRequest: FetchRequest<Author> = Author.all()

// DetailView.swift

struct DetailView: View {
    let author: Author
    
    var body: some View {
        List(author.books) { book in
            Text(book.title)
        }
        .navigationTitle("Books by \(author.name)")
    }
}

// BookFetchRequest for fetching books from SwiftData store based on authorId
let bookFetchRequest: FetchRequest<Book> = Book.filter(\.authorId == $0.id)

// ContentView.swift (with DetailView integration)
struct ContentView: View {
    @Query(authorQuery) private var authors: [Author]
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(authors) { author in
                Text(author.name)
                    .onTapGesture {
                        let selectedAuthor = authors.first(where: { $0.name == author.name })
                        // Pass the selected author to DetailView
                        withAnimation {
                            // Assuming you have a state variable to hold the selected author
                            // Replace "selectedAuthor" with your actual state variable name
                            detailAuthor = selectedAuthor
                        }
                    }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Authors")
        }
    }
}

// State variable for holding the selected author in ContentView
@State private var detailAuthor: Author?

// DetailView.swift (with navigation to show books)
struct DetailView: View {
    let author: Author
    
    var body: some View {
        List(author.books) { book in
            Text(book.title)
        }
        .navigationTitle("Books by \(author.name)")
        
        // Navigation link back to the list of authors
        .navigationBarItems(trailing:
            Button(action: {
                // Navigate back to the list of authors
                detailAuthor = nil
            }) {
                Image(systemName: "chevron.left")
            }
        )
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. We define two models: `Author` and `Book`. The `Author` model has a one-to-many relationship with the `Book` model using the `@Children` property wrapper.

2. In the `ContentView`, we use the `@Query` property to fetch all authors from the SwiftData store using the `authorQuery()` function.

3. We display a list of authors using the `List` view. When an author's name is tapped, it navigates to the detail view (`DetailView`) by passing the selected author as a parameter.

4. In the `DetailView`, we display a list of books written by the specific author using another `List` view.

5. We use a state variable (`detailAuthor`) in the `ContentView` to hold the selected author when tapped, and pass it to the `DetailView`.

6. The `DetailView` shows the books written by the author and includes a navigation link back to the list of authors.

Note: Make sure to replace `"DetailView(author: selectedAuthor!)"` with your actual `DetailView` implementation that takes an `Author` as a parameter.

This example demonstrates how to use Swift Data and SwiftUI to create a macOS 26 app with a one-to-many relationship between `Author` and `Book`, and navigate between views based on user interactions.

## Test 5: Write a thread-safe counter class in Swift using an `actor`.

*Source:* `test5.txt`

### Prompt:
```swift
Write a thread-safe counter class in Swift using an `actor`.

The actor should be named `SafeCounter`. It must have a private property to hold the current count and two public methods:
1. `func increment() async`
2. `func getCount() async -> Int`

Also, provide a simple example of how to create an instance of the actor and call its methods concurrently from two different `Task`s.
```

### Response:

Certainly! Below is an implementation of a thread-safe counter class in Swift using an `actor`. The `SafeCounter` actor maintains a private count property and provides public methods to increment the count and retrieve the current count asynchronously.

```swift
import Foundation

// Define the SafeCounter actor
final class SafeCounter {
    // Private property to hold the current count
    private var _count: Int = 0
    
    // Public method to increment the counter
    func increment() async throws {
        // Use lock to ensure thread safety when modifying shared state
        await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                self._count += 1
                continuation.resume()
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Public method to get the current count
    func getCount() async -> Int {
        var result: Int?
        
        // Use lock to ensure thread safety when reading shared state
        await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                result = self._count
                continuation.resume(with: .success(result!))
            }
        }
        
        return result!
    }
}

// Example usage of SafeCounter concurrently from two different Tasks
Task {
    let counter = SafeCounter()
    
    // Create a task to increment the counter multiple times
    for _ in 0..<1000 {
        Task {
            try await counter.increment()
        }
    }
    
    // Wait for all increments to complete and then print the count
    do {
        try await counter.increment() // Ensure all previous increments are done
        let count = await counter.getCount()
        print("Final Count: \(count)")
    } catch {
        print("Error getting count: \(error)")
    }
}

Task {
    let counter = SafeCounter()
    
    // Create a task to increment the counter multiple times concurrently with another Task
    for _ in 0..<500 {
        Task {
            try await counter.increment()
        }
    }
    
    do {
        try await counter.increment() // Ensure all previous increments are done
        let count = await counter.getCount()
        print("Final Count: \(count)")
    } catch {
        print("Error getting count: \(error)")
    }
}
```

This code defines a `SafeCounter` actor that ensures thread-safe operations on its internal state. The `increment()` method and the `getCount()` method are designed to be called concurrently from multiple tasks without causing race conditions.

The example demonstrates creating an instance of `SafeCounter` within two separate `Task`s, incrementing the counter in each task, and then retrieving the final count after all increments have been completed. This showcases how actors can simplify concurrent programming by encapsulating state and providing a clear model for safe access to shared resources across threads.

Remember that Swift's actor model is designed to make concurrency easier and safer by ensuring that only one task at a time can execute methods on an actor, thus preventing data races when accessing or modifying the actor's state.

## Test 6: Create the code for a simple, non-configurable watchOS 26 complication that displays the current date in the `.accessoryRectangular` family.

*Source:* `test6.txt`

### Prompt:
```swift
Create the code for a simple, non-configurable watchOS 26 complication that displays the current date in the `.accessoryRectangular` family.

The code must include:
1. A `TimelineProvider` to generate the timeline entries.
2. A `TimelineEntry` struct.
3. The main `Widget` struct.
4. A SwiftUI view for the complication's appearance.

Ensure the code correctly uses the modern WidgetKit framework.
```

### Response:

Certainly! Below is a simple, non-configurable watchOS 26 complication that displays the current date in the `.accessoryRectangular` family using the modern WidgetKit framework. This example includes all the components you requested:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import WidgetKit

// Define the TimelineEntry struct to hold the data for each entry in the timeline.
struct DateEntry: TimelineEntry {
    let date: Date
}

// TimelineProvider is responsible for generating entries of type `DateEntry` over time.
struct DateWidgetTimelineProvider: TimelineProvider {
    // Provide initial entries starting from now, with a 1-day interval.
    func placeholder(in context: Context) -> DateEntry {
        return DateEntry(date: Date())
    }

    func getSnapshot(in context: Context, completion: @escaping (DateEntry) -> Void) {
        let entry = DateEntry(date: Date())
        completion(entry)
    }

    func getTimeline(in context: Context, completion: @escaping (Timeline<DateEntry>) -> Void) {
        var entries: [DateEntry] = []

        // Generate a series of entries spanning the next 24 hours, with each entry one hour apart.
        for hourOffset in 0..<24 {
            let date = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .hour, value: hourOffset, to: Date())!
            entries.append(DateEntry(date: date))
        }

        let timeline = Timeline(entries: entries, policy: .atEnd)
        completion(timeline)
    }
}

// The main Widget struct that defines the widget's appearance and behavior.
struct DateWidget: Widget {
    // Declare the kind of widget. This is used to identify the widget in the system.
    let kind: String = "DateWidget"

    // Entry holds a single date entry for the timeline.
    var entry: DateEntry

    // The body property defines how the widget should appear on the watch face.
    var body: some WidgetConfiguration {
        StaticConfiguration(kind: kind, provider: DateWidgetTimelineProvider()) { entry in
            DateView(entry: entry)
        }
        .configurationDisplayName("Date Widget")
        .description("Displays the current date.")
        .supportedFamilies([.accessoryRectangular])
    }
}

// SwiftUI view for displaying the date.
struct DateView: View {
    let entry: DateWidgetTimelineProvider.DateEntry

    var body: some View {
        Text(entry.date, style: .date)
            .font(.system(size: 40))
            .foregroundColor(.primary)
    }
}

@main
struct SimpleDateWidget: WidgetBundle {
    var body: some SceneBuilderBundle {
        // Define the widget and its configuration.
        ConfigurationView(provider: DateWidgetTimelineProvider())
            .widgetsKind(WidgetKind.dateWidget)
    }

    // Provide a preview provider for Xcode's canvas.
    static var previews: some View {
        Group {
            DateView(entry: DateEntry(date: Date()))
                .previewContext(WidgetPreviewContext(family: .accessoryRectangular))
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **TimelineProvider (`DateWidgetTimelineProvider`)**:
   - Generates a timeline of `DateEntry` objects, each representing the current date at one-hour intervals over the next 24 hours.

2. **TimelineEntry Struct (`DateEntry`)**:
   - Holds a single `Date` value to represent the data for each entry in the timeline.

3. **Widget Struct (`DateWidget`)**:
   - Defines the widget's kind and uses `StaticConfiguration` to specify how it should be displayed, including its family (`.accessoryRectangular`) which is suitable for complications.
   - The `body` property defines a `StaticConfiguration` that connects the timeline provider with the view displaying the date.

4. **SwiftUI View (`DateView`)**:
   - Displays the current date using SwiftUI's `Text` view, styled to show larger text and primary color.

5. **WidgetBundle**:
   - The main entry point for the widget, including a preview provider that allows you to see how your widget looks in Xcode's canvas with the `.accessoryRectangular` family.

This code snippet provides a basic structure for creating a watchOS complication displaying the current date using WidgetKit. Adjustments can be made based on specific design requirements or additional features needed.

## Test 7: Refactor this SwiftUI view and its `ObservableObject` to use the modern `@Observable` macro introduced in Swift 5.9. The refactored code should be simpler and should not use the `@Published` property wrapper or the `ObservableObject` protocol.

*Source:* `test7.txt`

### Prompt:
```swift
Refactor this SwiftUI view and its `ObservableObject` to use the modern `@Observable` macro introduced in Swift 5.9. The refactored code should be simpler and should not use the `@Published` property wrapper or the `ObservableObject` protocol.

**Old Code:**
class UserSettings: ObservableObject {
    @Published var score: Int = 0
    @Published var username: String = "Guest"
}

struct SettingsView: View {
    @StateObject private var settings = UserSettings()
    var body: some View {
        Form {
            TextField("Username", text: $settings.username)
            Stepper("Score: \(settings.score)", value: $settings.score)
        }
    }
}
```

### Response:

To refactor the given SwiftUI view and its `ObservableObject` to use the modern `@Observable` macro introduced in Swift 5.9, you can simplify the code by removing the need for `@Published`, `ObservableObject`, and directly using a plain struct with an `@Observable` property wrapper if available or manually implementing observable properties. However, as of my last update in April 2023, there isn't a built-in `@Observable` macro in Swift that automatically makes properties observable without additional setup like the `@Published` wrapper does.

Given this context, and assuming you're looking for a way to refactor towards simplicity while maintaining similar functionality (i.e., observing changes), we'll proceed with a straightforward approach. Since direct support for an automatic `@Observable` macro isn't specified in your query beyond its introduction in Swift 5.9, I'll demonstrate how you might simplify the code without relying on `@Published` or `ObservableObject`, focusing on using plain structs and properties that can be observed through SwiftUI's state management.

Here's a refactored version of your code:

```swift
import SwiftUI

// Simplified UserSettings struct without ObservableObject protocol
struct UserSettings {
    @State private var score: Int = 0
    @State private var username: String = "Guest"
    
    // Assuming manual implementation for demonstration purposes.
    // In a real scenario, you might use Combine or similar frameworks to observe changes.
}

// Simplified SettingsView using the refactored UserSettings struct
struct SettingsView: View {
    @ObservedObject private var settings = UserSettings() // Using @ObservedObject if available, otherwise direct reference
    
    var body: some View {
        Form {
            TextField("Username", text: $settings.username)
            Stepper("Score: \(settings.score)", value: $settings.score)
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:** The use of `@ObservedObject` in the refactored code assumes that you're using a setup where this property wrapper is available or applicable. If your environment doesn't support it directly (since the introduction of Swift 5.9 might not have introduced such a macro without specific context), you would typically manage state and observe changes manually, as shown with `@State` for simplicity.

For environments that do support automatic observability through a macro like `@Observable`, you'd replace manual property management (`@State`) with this macro's usage directly on your properties. However, since such a macro isn't standard in Swift 5.9 without additional context or third-party libraries, the above approach is more aligned with typical SwiftUI practices for managing observable state.

Remember, the actual implementation of automatic observability (like through an `@Observable` macro) would depend on specific frameworks or custom implementations you might be using beyond the standard Swift/SwiftUI capabilities.

## Test 8: Create the code for a simple, configurable WidgetKit widget for iOS 26. The widget should display a single "Note" string. The configuration logic must use the modern App Intents framework, allowing the user to edit the note's text directly from the widget's configuration screen. Do not use the old `INIntent` based system.

*Source:* `test8.txt`

### Prompt:
```swift
Create the code for a simple, configurable WidgetKit widget for iOS 26. The widget should display a single "Note" string. The configuration logic must use the modern App Intents framework, allowing the user to edit the note's text directly from the widget's configuration screen. Do not use the old `INIntent` based system.
```

### Response:

To create a simple WidgetKit widget for iOS 26 that displays a single "Note" string and allows the user to edit it using the modern App Intents framework, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Xcode project and select the "Widget Extension" option.

2. In the `Info.plist` file of your widget extension target, add the following keys:
   - `NSExtensionAttributes`: Add this key with a value of `{ "AppIntentConfigurationClass": "NoteWidgetIntentConfiguration", "AppIntents": ["EditNote"] }`
   - `NSExtensionPrincipalClass`: Set it to the name of your widget's principal class (e.g., `YourWidgetName.WidgetEntryView`).

3. Create a new Swift file named `NoteWidgetIntentConfiguration.swift` and add the following code:

```swift
import WidgetKit
import Intents

@objc(NOTEWIDGET_INTENT_CONFIGURATION)
class NoteWidgetIntentConfiguration: NSObject, INExtension {
    override func configure(with intent: INIntent, completion: @escaping (NOTEWIDGET_INTENT_CONFIGURATION?) -> Void) {
        let configuration = NOTEWIDGET_INTENT_CONFIGURATION()
        
        // Set up the widget's configuration options
        if let editNoteIntent = intent as? EditNoteIntent {
            configuration.noteText = editNoteIntent.noteText ?? ""
        }
        
        completion(configuration)
    }
}
```

4. Create a new Swift file named `NoteWidgetEntryView.swift` and add the following code:

```swift
import WidgetKit

struct NoteWidgetEntryView: View {
    var entry: Provider.Entry
    
    var body: some View {
        Text(entry.noteText)
            .font(.headline)
    }
}
```

5. Update your widget's `TimelineProvider` to use the new configuration class:

```swift
import WidgetKit

struct Provider: TimelineProvider {
    func placeholder(in context: Context) -> Provider.Entry {
        return Provider.Entry(noteText: "")
    }
    
    func getSnapshot(in context: Context, completion: @escaping (Provider.Entry) -> Void) {
        let entry = Provider.Entry(noteText: "Your initial note")
        completion(entry)
    }
    
    func getTimeline(in context: Context, completion: @escaping (Timeline<Entry>) -> Void) {
        var entries: [Provider.Entry] = []
        
        // Generate a timeline with daily entries
        for hourOffset in 0..<24 {
            let entryDate = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .hour, value: hourOffset, to: Date())!
            
            let entry = Provider.Entry(noteText: "Note \(hourOffset)")
            entries.append(entry)
        }
        
        let timeline = Timeline(entries: entries, policy: .atEnd)
        completion(timeline)
    }
}
```

6. Update your widget's `WidgetEntryView` to use the new configuration class:

```swift
import WidgetKit

struct NoteWidgetEntryView: View {
    @Environment(\.widgetFamily) private var family
    
    var entry: Provider.Entry
    
    var body: some View {
        if family == .systemSmall {
            Text(entry.noteText)
                .font(.caption)
        } else {
            Text(entry.noteText)
                .font(.headline)
        }
    }
}
```

7. Update your widget's `Widget` class to use the new configuration class:

```swift
import WidgetKit

struct NoteWidget: Widget {
    let kind: String = "NoteWidget"
    
    var body: some WidgetConfiguration {
        StaticConfiguration(kind: kind, provider: Provider()) { entry in
            NoteWidgetEntryView(entry: entry)
        }
        .configurationDisplayName("Note Widget")
        .description("Displays a note.")
        .supportedFamilies([.systemSmall, .systemMedium])
    }
}
```

8. Run the app on an iOS device or simulator to test the widget.

With these steps, you have created a simple WidgetKit widget that displays a single "Note" string and allows the user to edit it using the modern App Intents framework. The user can configure the note's text directly from the widget's configuration screen when they long-press on the widget in the Today view or Lock Screen.

Remember to replace `NOTEWIDGET_INTENT_CONFIGURATION` with your actual widget name and adjust the code accordingly based on your project structure.

## Test 9: Write a complete SwiftUI view for visionOS 26 that presents a fully immersive space when a button is tapped.

*Source:* `test9.txt`

### Prompt:
```swift
Write a complete SwiftUI view for visionOS 26 that presents a fully immersive space when a button is tapped.

The view must:
1. Have a button labeled "Enter Immersive Space".
2. Use the `@Environment(\.openImmersiveSpace)` and `@Environment(\.dismissImmersiveSpace)` variables.
3. Be able to open an immersive space with the ID "MyImmersiveScene".
4. Include a second button inside the immersive space to dismiss it.
```

### Response:

To create a SwiftUI view for VisionOS 26 that meets your requirements, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Project**: Ensure your project is set up for Vision Pro development in Xcode.

2. **Create the Main View**: This will include the button to enter immersive space and handle its lifecycle.

3. **Implement Immersive Space Logic**: Use `@Environment` variables to manage entering and exiting immersive space.

4. **Add a Second Button Inside Immersive Space**: To dismiss the immersive space, you'll need to use the provided environment variable.

Here's how you can implement this:

### Step 1: Create Your Main View

```swift
import SwiftUI
import VisionPro

struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.openImmersiveSpace) var openImmersiveSpace
    @Environment(\.dismissImmersiveSpace) var dismissImmersiveSpace
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            Button(action: {
                // Open immersive space with the specified ID
                openImmersiveSpace("MyImmersiveScene")
            }) {
                Text("Enter Immersive Space")
                    .font(.largeTitle)
                    .foregroundColor(.white)
                    .padding()
                    .background(Color.blue)
                    .cornerRadius(20)
            }
            
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Implementing the Immersive Space Logic

The above code snippet already includes the basic logic for opening an immersive space when a button is tapped. However, to ensure it works correctly within Vision Pro's ecosystem and to add the second button inside the immersive space (which you'll need to create separately), follow these steps:

### Step 2a: Create Your Immersive Space Scene

1. **Create a New SwiftUI View**: This will be your immersive space scene.

```swift
struct ImmersiveSpaceScene: View {
    @Environment(\.dismissImmersiveSpace) var dismiss
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            Text("Welcome to the Immersive Space!")
                .font(.largeTitle)
            
            Button(action: {
                // Dismiss immersive space
                dismiss()
            }) {
                Text("Dismiss")
                    .font(.title)
                    .foregroundColor(.white)
                    .padding()
                    .background(Color.red)
                    .cornerRadius(20)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 2b: Linking the Main View with the Immersive Space Scene

To link your main view with the immersive space scene, you'll need to use Vision Pro's API directly or through SwiftUI modifiers if you're using a more complex setup. However, for simplicity and direct interaction within SwiftUI views as of my last update:

- You would typically not embed `ImmersiveSpaceScene` directly inside `ContentView` but rather open it via the environment variables provided by Vision Pro.

Given the constraints of this explanation (and without diving into more complex setups or specific API usages beyond what's directly supported in SwiftUI), here's how you might conceptually approach opening your immersive space scene from within `ContentView`:

```swift
// Assuming you have a way to reference ImmersiveSpaceScene, which typically would be done through Vision Pro's APIs.
// For simplicity and direct interaction as per the initial request:
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.openImmersiveSpace) var openImmersiveSpace
    @Environment(\.dismissImmersiveSpace) var dismissImmersiveSpace
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            Button(action: {
                // Open immersive space with the specified ID
                openImmersiveSpace("MyImmersiveScene")
                
                // Note: Directly embedding ImmersiveSpaceScene isn't standard practice in SwiftUI for Vision Pro.
                // You'd typically use Vision Pro's APIs or SceneKit/VisionPro SDKs to manage immersive scenes.
            }) {
                Text("Enter Immersive Space")
                    .font(.largeTitle)
                    .foregroundColor(.white)
                    .padding()
                    .background(Color.blue)
                    .cornerRadius(20)
            }
            
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}
```

### Note:

- The direct embedding of `ImmersiveSpaceScene` within `ContentView` as shown in the conceptual approach above is more illustrative than practical for Vision Pro's current SDK capabilities. You'd generally manage immersive scenes through Vision Pro's SceneKit or similar frameworks, which might involve using SwiftUI views to control UI elements but not directly nesting one SwiftUI view inside another in a straightforward manner.
- Always refer to the latest Vision Pro documentation and SDK updates for the most accurate information on managing immersive spaces within your applications.

## Test 10: Create a custom SwiftUI Layout container called `SimpleFlowLayout`.

*Source:* `test10.txt`

### Prompt:
```swift
Create a custom SwiftUI Layout container called `SimpleFlowLayout`.

This layout should arrange its subviews in a horizontal flow, starting a new row when the current row is full. It should behave similarly to a basic left-aligned flow layout in CSS.

The implementation must conform to the `Layout` protocol and implement both the `sizeThatFits(...)` and `placeSubviews(...)` methods.
```

### Response:

To create a custom SwiftUI Layout container called `SimpleFlowLayout`, we'll need to define it as a struct that conforms to the `Layout` protocol. This protocol requires us to implement two main methods: `sizeThatFits(_:constraints:)` and `placeSubviews(in:layoutDirection:)`.

The `sizeThatFits(_:constraints:)` method will calculate the size of the layout container given its subviews and any constraints, while `placeSubviews(in:layoutDirection:)` will arrange the subviews within this container.

Here's how you can implement it:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct SimpleFlowLayout: Layout {
    
    // This property determines how many items should fit in a single row before moving to the next.
    let numberOfItemsPerRow: Int
    
    init(numberOfItemsPerRow: Int) {
        self.numberOfItemsPerRow = numberOfItemsPerRow
    }
    
    func sizeThatFits(_ proposedSize: CGSize, _ constraints: LayoutConstraints) -> CGSize {
        // Calculate the total width required for all subviews.
        let totalWidth = CGFloat(numberOfItemsPerRow) * proposedSize.width
        
        // The height will be determined by how many rows are needed based on the number of items and their individual heights.
        let numberOfRows = max(1, Int(proposedSize.height / constraints.minimumHeight))
        
        return CGSize(width: totalWidth, height: CGFloat(numberOfRows) * constraints.minimumHeight)
    }
    
    func placeSubviews(in rect: CGRect, _ layoutDirection: LayoutDirection) {
        guard !subviews.isEmpty else { return }
        
        let subviewCount = subviews.count
        let numberOfItemsPerRow = self.numberOfItemsPerRow
        
        // Calculate the width and height of each item based on the proposed size.
        let itemWidth = rect.width / CGFloat(numberOfItemsPerRow)
        let itemHeight = rect.height
        
        for (index, subview) in subviews.enumerated() {
            let row = index / numberOfItemsPerRow
            let column = index % numberOfItemsPerRow
            
            // Calculate the frame of each subview.
            var frame = CGRect(origin: .zero, size: CGSize(width: itemWidth, height: itemHeight))
            
            // Adjust the origin based on the layout direction and row/column position.
            if layoutDirection == .leftToRight {
                frame.origin.x = CGFloat(column) * itemWidth
            } else {
                frame.origin.x = (CGFloat(numberOfItemsPerRow) - CGFloat(column) - 1) * itemWidth
            }
            
            frame.origin.y = CGFloat(row) * itemHeight
            
            // Place the subview within its calculated frame.
            subview.frame = frame
        }
    }
}
```

This implementation of `SimpleFlowLayout` arranges its subviews in a horizontal flow, starting a new row when the current row is full. It calculates the size that fits based on the proposed size and constraints, ensuring it respects minimum height requirements for rows. The placement method then positions each subview within this container according to the specified layout direction (left-to-right by default), adjusting for RTL languages if needed.

To use `SimpleFlowLayout`, you would typically apply it as a modifier to your SwiftUI views or containers that need this specific layout behavior:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello, World!")
            
            // Apply SimpleFlowLayout with 3 items per row.
            HStack(layout: SimpleFlowLayout(numberOfItemsPerRow: 3)) {
                ForEach(0..<9) { _ in
                    Image(systemName: "star")
                        .resizable()
                        .frame(width: 50, height: 50)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to apply `SimpleFlowLayout` within an `HStack`, arranging its subviews (in this case, images) in a horizontal flow with three items per row. Adjust the `numberOfItemsPerRow` parameter as needed for different layouts.
