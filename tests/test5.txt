Write a thread-safe counter class in Swift using an `actor`.

The actor should be named `SafeCounter`. It must have a private property to hold the current count and two public methods:
1. `func increment() async`
2. `func getCount() async -> Int`

Also, provide a simple example of how to create an instance of the actor and call its methods concurrently from two different `Task`s.
